    <title>Targeted Peak Search</title>
    <div>
        Suppose we want to quantify all peaks containing an immonium signature ion. We can search for this like:
            --scan-file xxx.mzML --msn-ion 216.043
        If we wish to add the additional restriction that the fragment is tryptic (ends with a lysine or arginine), we can add their y<sub>1</sub> ions as well.
            --scan-file xxx.mzML --msn-ion 216.043 147 175
